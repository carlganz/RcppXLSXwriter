[![Project Status: WIP ? Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carlganz/RcppXLSXwriter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carlganz/RcppXLSXwriter)

This package uses John McNamara's C library [libxlsxwriter](http://libxlsxwriter.github.io/) and [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/) to let R users generate customized XLSX files in R. The [`WriteXLS`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WriteXLS/index.html) package on CRAN is nice, but it requires Perl, and it isn't flexible enough to allow the user to fully customize their Excel output. 

With `RcppXLSXwriter` you have the ability to customize each and every cell in your XLSX document. 
## Issues

### Portability 

So far I have only been able to get the package to build on 32-bit R on Windows. 

## Usage

Although `RcppXLSXwriter` only has its bare infrastructure, you still get most of the functionality of libxlsxwriter if you're willing to be verbose. 

- First you must build a workbook with `new(XLSXworkbook, *file*)`
- Next you bulid a worksheet in the workbook with `new(XLSXworksheet,*workbook*,*sheetname*)`
- Now you can write to the worksheet with `write` by specifying the x and y range you want to fill, and then giving a character matrix of the same dimension
- You can add formatted content by first creating a format object with `new(XLSXformat,*workbook*)`,adding properties to the format object with its methods, and then passing it to `writef`

Here is a quick example for writing `iris` with bold, exciting header:

```{R}
library(RcppXLSXwriter)

# create workbook
wb <- new(XLSXworkbook, "newFile.xlsx")

# create worksheet
ws <- new(XLSXworksheet, wb, "firstSheet")

# create format for title
titleFmt <- new(XLSXformat, wb)

# set format to font 24, times new roman, bold, underline, and italic
titleFmt$font_size(24)
titleFmt$font_name("times new roman")
titleFmt$bold()
titleFmt$underline()
titleFmt$italic()

# write title
ws$writef(1,seq_len(ncol(iris)),t(as.matrix(names(iris))),titleFmt)

# write data
ws$write(1+seq_len(nrow(iris)),seq_len(ncol(iris)),as.matrix(iris))

# close
wb$close()

```
